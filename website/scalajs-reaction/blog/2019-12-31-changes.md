The jar file group and package names have been shortened to remove
scalajs-reaction from the names. This makes it easier to 
specify them in your build.sbt file.

The package hierarchy has also changed. Since you are
only likely to include one react package in your application
the use of "ttg" was burdonsome. For most of the core
packages, the ttg package prefix has been removed. For
example instead of importing `import ttg.react._` you
would now just do `import react._`.
