A large number of API tweaks have been made and there has 
been an expansion of hand-crafted facades available including
many needed for production web applications.

Also, many of the scala.js specific helpers have been
split out to a separate project that is *not* dependent
on the DOM and can be used both server and client side.
See the `jshelpers` sub-project for details. The helpers
include extensive `js.Promise` extensions that make them
much more friendly to `scala` developers.
