You can create your project structure any way you want. Traditional scala
project structures do not easily match javascript project structures. javascript
project structures are vary widely due to the bundling requirements--a bit of
the wild west.

You could use a dominant project structure. For example if your project is
mostly javascript with some scala, you can use a javascript dominant model, or
vice versa if your project is mostly scala based.
