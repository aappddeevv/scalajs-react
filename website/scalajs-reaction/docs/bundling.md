Bundling is the process of taking your scala.js program, ensuring that all
dependencies are identified then creating an output file suitable for use on the
web or on a mobile device.

A special bundler that understands http and file URLs is available at
[scalajs-friendly-source-map-loader](https://github.com/aappddeevv/scalajs-friendly-source-map-loader)
for bundling scalajs-reaction programs. It will work with any scala.js source
file and is not specific to scalajs-reaction. Please see that page for
directions.
