A few facades are provided, or at least, a WIP version is provided.

# fabric

[Fabric](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react) is a Microsoft
react UI library with many components and is freely available to make office
looking interfaces. It also has many infrastructure functions to handle themes
and styling. A simple facade has been included in `scalajs-react-fabric` that is
a WIP since the API is quite large and complex. Fabric is written in
typescript. `scalajs-react`s demo application was written mostly with fabric.

The lib is `scalajs-react-fabric`.

# Material UI

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com) is google inspired react library. These
binding are provisional until v4 comes out. Styling is based on
[CSSinJS](https://github.com/cssinjs).

The lib is `scalajs-react-material-ui`.


# Bootstrap

[bootstrap]() is a bootstrap inspired binding. However, the bootstrap react
project is still maturing and we will wait for it to mature a bit more until we
complete the bindings for it. Styling is still maturing.

The lib is `scalajs-react-bootstrap`.
