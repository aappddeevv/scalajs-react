# Data Validation

A simple applicative-style data validation library has been provided. You can
use it for both JVM and JS environments os it useful for both the backend and
the fronted. It is agnostic to the data structures used to capture data
validation information so it does not impose its on "error" class or the use of
`Either` or cats `Validated`. Of course, such flexibility comes at a price.
