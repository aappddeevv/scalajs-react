# Importing from JS

Importing a component javascript means you need to create a "Component" in
scala. There is a simple function call to do that for you. You still need to
perform the scala.js `@JSImport`.

```scala
// import a react component exported as part of a namespace export
// perhaps mark the import private
@js.native
@JSImport("some-lib", JSImport.Namespace)
object SomeLibNS {
  val YourComponent1: ReactJSComponent = js.native
  val YourComponent2: ReactJSComponent = js.native
}

// create a proxy component for it
object SomeLib {
  import ttg.react.elements._
  def YourComponent1(props: Attr*)(children: ReactNode*) = 
     wrapJsForScala(SomeLibNS.YourComponent1, new Attrs(props).toJs, children:_*)
}
```

A component, declared as a react class, should be typed as a `ReactJSComponent`.

How you hook up attributes and children values to your component is up to
you. The definition in SomeLib is what you want it to be. In typescript, it is
common to define an interface that declares the allowed properties to be passed
in. The equivalent in scala.js are JS traits. You will want to make them
non-native JS traits so you can instantiate them.

```scala
trait YourComponent1Props extends js.Object {
  val className: js.UndefOr[String] = js.undefined
}
```

Then you can define:

```scala
object SomeLib {
  import ttg.react.elements._
  // you can also use js.UndefOr[YourComponentProps] = js.undefined
  def YourComponent1(props: YourComponent1Props = null)(children: ReactNode*) = 
     wrapJsForScala(SomeLibNS, new Attrs(props).toJs, children:_*)
}
```

You can use more fancy approaches to consolidating your imported component's
properties into a js.Object, it's up to you.

## Managing Javascript Props

If you need to include additional HTML specific props, you can use the vdom
package. Let's say you want to be able to pass in any HTML element properties to
your component.

```scala
import ttg.react.vdom._

trait YourComponent1 extends HTMLAttributes[dom.html.Element] {
  // className already declared in HTMLAttributes.
}
```

## Import Typescript SFC

A stateless functional component is just a function. However, react can take a
function definition in its `React.createElement` API. Hence, you can import a
SFC and just "label" it a `ReactJSComponent`. Here's an example:

```typescript
import * as React from "react"
import { Address } from "./datamodel"
import cx = require("classnames")

export interface Props {
    className?: string | null
    address?: Address | null
}

/** Summarize address. */
export const AddressSummary: React.SFC<Address> = (props?: Props) => {
    props = props || {}
    const name = (props && props.address && props.address.name) || "<unnamed address>"
    return (
        <div className={cx("addressSummary", props.className)}>
            Typescript sourced: Address Summary: {name}
        </div>
    )
}
```

`Address` is defined in typescript language and represents an interface you need
to type in:

```typescript
// We have to define this on the scala.js and typescript side.
export interface Address {
    customeraddressid: string | null
    name?: string | null
    city?: string | null
    stateorprovince?: string | null
    postalcode?: string | null
}
```

The key thing to notice is that the SFC takes a js object with two optional
parameters. Let's import it into scala.js

```scala
import scala.scalajs.js
import js.annotation.JSImport
import ttg.react._
import ttg.react.elements._
import js.Dynamic.literal
import js.JSConverters._

@js.native
@JSImport("JSExamples/AddressSummary", JSImport.Namespace)
object AddressSummaryNS extends js.Object {
  val AddressSummary: ReactJSComponent = js.native
}

object AddressSummary {
  def make(className: Option[String] = None, address: Option[Address] = None) = {
    val props = literal(
      "className" -> className.orUndefined,
      "address" -> address.orUndefined
    )
    elements.wrapJsForScala(AddressSummaryNS.AddressSummary, props)
  }
}
```

All we need is a `make` function that represents the API you choose to provide
the scala.js code. In this case, we provide two parameters, wrapped in Option,
that gives us the scala side. The code between the def and the call to
`wrapJsForScala` translates between scala side objects and objects needed for
javascript. In this case, since the def defines the strongly typed API, we use a
literal to create the argument to the typescript component. We do not need a
non-native JS trait since the trait would no be exposed. This is the choice made
for this component. Another imported component may have so many parameters that
we choose to expose a scala object or a non-native JS trait for the caller to
use.

With the JSConverters import, we can convert an `Option` to an `UndefOr` with
`orUndefined`. A js literal is created as a js.Dynamic with js.Object hence its
already a js.Object which is the parameter type in `wrapJsForScala`.

## Typescript

If you have typescript definitions you may want to try to convert them to a
native JS trait. There are converters you can try:

* [definitely typed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
* [scala-js-ts-importer](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-ts-importer)

You may find that for complicated libraries the conversion is not accurate and
you still need hand editing or that the conversion fails.
