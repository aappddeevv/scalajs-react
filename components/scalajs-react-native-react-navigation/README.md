# react-navigation

A complex module to help make navigation easier. It's fairly complex but less
complex than the android java SDK's protocol and navigation in the architecture
components (now that's complex!).

You need to follow the instructions at the react-navigation
[site](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html).
